An individualized flow and app will need to be provided per group. 

1. A sign-in form and register form need to be created, and the power app needs to use the qr code provided by the sign-in app.
2. All flow values with an asterisk "*" will need to be updated based on changes in forms or raisers edge database. All names are either explanations of their function, or instructions on what value to put in the module.
3. Update the power app to ensure it changes pages when data is received from data set, rather than a sharepoint.
